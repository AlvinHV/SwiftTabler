# SwiftTabler

A multi-platform SwiftUI component for tabular data.

**NOTE** <em>this component is BRAND NEW and under active development. If you need stability, you should fork, at least until the API has stabilized with version 1.x.x.</em>


Available as an open source library to be incorporated in SwiftUI apps.

_SwiftTabular_ is part of the [OpenAlloc](https://github.com/openalloc) family of open source Swift software tools.

## Features

* Convenient display of tabular data from a `RandomAccessCollection` or Core Data source
* Presently targeting macOS v11+ and iOS v14+\*
* Supporting bound and unbound arrays, and Core Data too
* With bound data, add inline controls to interactively change (and mutate) your data model
* Optional sort-by-column support, with indicators and concise syntax
* Optional support for row background, with selection overlay
* MINIMAL use of View erasure (i.e., use of `AnyView`), which can impact scalability and performance\*\*
* No external dependencies!

For List-based tables:
* Optional moving of rows through drag and drop
* Support for single-select, multi-select, or no selection at all

For ScrollView/LazyVStack-based tables:
* Support for single-select and no selection at all

For ScrollView/LazyVGrid-based tables:
* Likely the most scalable and efficient, but least flexible

On macOS:
* Hovering highlight, indicating which row the mouse is over

Notes:

\* Other platforms like macCatalyst, iPad on Mac, watchOS, tvOS, etc. are poorly supported, if at all. Please contribute to improve support!

\*\* AnyView only used to specify sort configuration images in configuration, which shouldn't impact scalability.

## Tabler Example

The example below shows the display of tabular data from an array of values using `TablerList`, a simple variant based on `List`.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Tabler

struct Fruit: Identifiable {
    var id: String
    var name: String
    var weight: Double
    var color: Color
}

struct ContentView: View {

    @State private var fruits: [Fruit] = [
        Fruit(id: "üçå", name: "Banana", weight: 118, color: .brown),
        Fruit(id: "üçì", name: "Strawberry", weight: 12, color: .red),
        Fruit(id: "üçä", name: "Orange", weight: 190, color: .orange),
        Fruit(id: "ü•ù", name: "Kiwi", weight: 75, color: .green),
        Fruit(id: "üçá", name: "Grape", weight: 7, color: .purple),
        Fruit(id: "ü´ê", name: "Blueberry", weight: 2, color: .blue),
    ]
    
    private var gridItems: [GridItem] = [
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 35, maximum: 40), alignment: .leading),
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 100), alignment: .leading),
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 40, maximum: 80), alignment: .trailing),
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 35, maximum: 50), alignment: .leading),
    ]

    private typealias Context = TablerContext<Fruit>

    private func header(ctx: Binding<Context>) -> some View {
        LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
            Text("ID")
            Text("Name")
            Text("Weight")
            Text("Color")
        }
    }
    
    private func row(element: Fruit) -> some View {
        LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
            Text(element.id)
            Text(element.name).foregroundColor(element.color)
            Text(String(format: "%.0f g", element.weight))
            Image(systemName: "rectangle.fill").foregroundColor(element.color)
        }
    }

    var body: some View {
        TablerList(header: header,
                   row: row,
                   results: fruits)
    }
}
```

While `LazyVGrid` is used to wrap the header and row items, you could alternatively wrap them with `HStack` or similar mechanism.

## Tabler Views

You can choose from any of eighteen (18) variants, which break down along the following lines:

* Base - three foundations: `List`, `ScrollView/LazyVStack`, and `ScrollView/LazyVGrid`
* Select - single-select, and multi-select, or selection not supported
* RAC - can be used with `RandomAccessCollection` (e.g., array of struct values)
* CD - can be used with Core Data
* Filter - is `config.filter` supported?
* Bound - the mechanism through which values are bound, if at all
* View - the view to use

Base   | Select | RAC | CD  | Filter | Bound             | View      
---    | ---    | --- | --- | ---    | ---               | ---           
List   |        |  ‚úì  |  ‚úì  |  ‚úì     |                   | TablerList    
List   |        |  ‚úì  |     |  ‚úì\*   | Binding\<Element> | TablerListB   
List   |        |     |  ‚úì  |        | NSManagedObject   | TablerListC    
List   | Single |  ‚úì  |  ‚úì  |  ‚úì     |                   | TablerList1   
List   | Single |  ‚úì  |     |  ‚úì\*   | Binding\<Element> | TablerList1B  
List   | Single |     |  ‚úì  |        | NSManagedObject   | TablerList1C   
List   | Multi  |  ‚úì  |  ‚úì  |  ‚úì     |                   | TablerListM   
List   | Multi  |  ‚úì  |     |  ‚úì\*   | Binding\<Element> | TablerListMB  
List   | Multi  |     |  ‚úì  |        | NSManagedObject   | TablerListMC   
Stack  |        |  ‚úì  |  ‚úì  |  ‚úì     |                   | TablerStack

Stack  | Single |     |  ‚úì  |        | NSManagedObject   | TablerStack1C  
Grid   |        |  ‚úì  |  ‚úì  |  ‚úì     |                   | TablerGrid    
Grid   |        |  ‚úì  |     |        | Binding\<Element> | TablerGridB         
Grid   |        |     |  ‚úì  |        | NSManagedObject   | TablerGridC           

\* filtering with Binding-based data likely not scalable as implemented. If you can find a better way to implement, submit a pull request!

## Column Sorting

Column sorting is available through the `tablerSort` view function.

The examples below show how the header items can support sort.

`columnTitle` is a convenience function that displays header name along with an indicator showing the current sort state, if any.

Caret images are used by default, but are configurable.

### Random Access Collection

From the _TablerDemo_ app:

```swift
private typealias Context = TablerContext<Fruit>
private typealias Sort = TablerSort<Fruit>

private func header(ctx: Binding<Context>) -> some View {
    LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
        Sort.columnTitle("ID", ctx, \.id)
            .onTapGesture { tablerSort(ctx, &fruits, \.id) { $0.id < $1.id } }
        Sort.columnTitle("Name", ctx, \.name)
            .onTapGesture { tablerSort(ctx, &fruits, \.name) { $0.name < $1.name } }
        Sort.columnTitle("Weight", ctx, \.weight)
            .onTapGesture { tablerSort(ctx, &fruits, \.weight) { $0.weight < $1.weight } }
        Text("Color")
    }
}
```

### Core Data

The sort method used with Core Data differs. From the _TablerCoreDemo_ app:

```swift
private typealias Context = TablerContext<Fruit>
private typealias Sort = TablerSort<Fruit>

private func header(ctx: Binding<Context>) -> some View {
    LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems, alignment: .leading) {
        Sort.columnTitle("ID", ctx, \.id)
            .onTapGesture { fruits.sortDescriptors = [tablerSort(ctx, \.id)] }
        Sort.columnTitle("Name", ctx, \.name)
            .onTapGesture { fruits.sortDescriptors = [tablerSort(ctx, \.name)] }
        Sort.columnTitle("Weight", ctx, \.weight)
            .onTapGesture { fruits.sortDescriptors = [tablerSort(ctx, \.weight)] }
    }
}
```

## Bound data

:---:|:---:
![](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftTabler/blob/main/Images/macOSb.png)  |  ![](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftTabler/blob/main/Images/iOSb.png)

When used with 'bound' variants (e.g., `TablerListB` or `TablerListC`), the data can be modified directly, mutating your data source. From the demo:

```swift
private func brow(element: BoundValue) -> some View {
    LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
        Text(element.wrappedValue.id)
        TextField("Name", text: element.name)
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        Text(String(format: "%.0f g", element.wrappedValue.weight))
        ColorPicker("Color", selection: element.color)
            .labelsHidden()
    }
}
```

### Random Access Collection

For Random Access Collection sources, `BoundValue` is:

```swift
typealias BoundValue = Binding<Fruit>
```

### Core Data

For Core Data sources, `BoundValue` is:

```swift
typealias BoundValue = ObservedObject<Fruit>.Wrapper
```

Also known as `ProjectedValue`.

Note that for Core Data, the user's changes will need to be saved to the Managed Object Context. See the _TablerCoreData_ code for an example of how this might be done.

## Row Background

macOS | iOS
:---:|:---:
![](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftTabler/blob/main/Images/macOSc.png)  |  ![](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftTabler/blob/main/Images/iOSc.png)

```swift
var body: some View {
    TablerList(header: header,
               row: row,
               rowBackground: rowBackgroundAction,
               results: fruits)
}

private func rowBackgroundAction(fruit: Fruit) -> some View {
    LinearGradient(gradient: .init(colors: [fruit.color, fruit.color.opacity(0.2)]),
                   startPoint: .top, 
                   endPoint: .bottom)
}
```

Where you're using selection with row background, you may want to use a 'selection overlay', as the normal selection may be obscured. See _TablerDemo_ for examples.

Also, when using a row background on macOS, you might wish to disable the hover effect.

```swift
typealias Config = TablerListConfig<Fruit>

var body: some View {
    TablerList(Config(hoverColor: .clear),
               header: header,
               row: row,
               rowBackground: rowBackgroundAction,
               results: fruits)
}
```

## Headless Tables

Where you don't want a header, simply omit it from the declaration of the table:

```swift
var body: some View {
    TablerList(row: row,
               results: fruits)
}
```

## Moving Rows

TODO add details here, with example of move action handler.

## Horizontal Scrolling

On compact displays you may wish to scroll the table horizontally. _TablerDemo_ does this through a `ScrollView` wrapper:

```swift
public struct SidewaysScroller<Content: View>: View {
    var minWidth: CGFloat
    @ViewBuilder var content: () -> Content

    public init(minWidth: CGFloat,
                @ViewBuilder content: @escaping () -> Content)
    {
        self.minWidth = minWidth
        self.content = content
    }

    public var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { geo in
            ScrollView(.horizontal) {
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    content()
                }
                .frame(minWidth: max(minWidth, geo.size.width))
            }
        }
    }
}
```
