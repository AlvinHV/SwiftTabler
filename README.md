# SwiftTabler

A multi-platform SwiftUI component for displaying (and interacting with) tabular data.

Available as an open source Swift library to be incorporated in other apps.

_SwiftTabular_ is part of the [OpenAlloc](https://github.com/openalloc) family of open source Swift software tools.

## Features

* Convenient display of `RandomAccessCollection` tabular data in your app
* Presently targeting macOS v11+ and iOS v14+\*\*
* Supporting bound and unbound arrays, and Core Data too
* With bound data, add inline controls to interactively change (and mutate) your data model
* Optional sort by column support, with concise syntax
* Optional support for colored rows, with selection overlay
* No type erasure (i.e., use of `AnyView`) which can impact scalability and performance
* No external dependencies!

For `List`-based tables:
* Optional moving of rows through drag and drop
* Support for no-select, single-select, and multi-select

For `ScrollView`/`LazyVStack`-based tables:
* Support for no-select, single-select (possibily multi-select in future)

On macOS:
* Hovering highlight, indicating which row the mouse is over

\*\* Other platforms like macCatalyst, iPad on Mac, watchOS, tvOS, etc. are poorly supported, if at all. Please contribute to improve support!

## Tabler Example

The basic example below shows the basic display of tabular data using `TablerList`, which is for the display of unbound data without any selection capability.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Tabler

struct Fruit: Identifiable {
    var id: String
    var name: String
    var weight: Double
    var color: Color
}

struct ContentView: View {

    @State private var fruits: [Fruit] = [
        Fruit(id: "üçå", name: "Banana", weight: 118, color: .brown),
        Fruit(id: "üçì", name: "Strawberry", weight: 12, color: .red),
        Fruit(id: "üçä", name: "Orange", weight: 190, color: .orange),
        Fruit(id: "ü•ù", name: "Kiwi", weight: 75, color: .green),
        Fruit(id: "üçá", name: "Grape", weight: 7, color: .purple),
        Fruit(id: "ü´ê", name: "Blueberry", weight: 2, color: .blue),
    ]
    
    private var gridItems: [GridItem] = [
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 10, maximum: 40), alignment: .leading),
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 100), alignment: .leading),
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 40), alignment: .trailing),
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 40), alignment: .leading),
    ]

    private func header(_ ctx: TablerSortContext<Fruit>) -> some View {
        LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
            Text("ID")
            Text("Name")
            Text("Weight")
            Text("Color")
        }
        .padding(.horizontal)
    }
    
    private func row(_ element: Fruit) -> some View {
        LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
            Text(element.id)
            Text(element.name).foregroundColor(element.color)
            Text(String(format: "%.0f g", element.weight))
            Image(systemName: "rectangle.fill").foregroundColor(element.color)
        }
        .padding(.horizontal)
        .padding(.vertical, 5)
    }

    var body: some View {
        TablerList(config,
                   headerContent: header,
                   rowContent: row,
                   results: fruits)
            .padding()
    }
    
    private var config: TablerListConfig<Fruit> {
        TablerListConfig<Fruit>()
    }
}
```

## Tables

You can choose from any of ten (10) variants, which break down along the following lines:

* Both `List`-based and `ScrollView`/`LazyVStack`-based.
* Selection types offered: none, single-select, and multi-select (`List` only presently)
* Unbound elements in row view, where you're presenting table rows read-only\*
* Bound elements in row view, where you're presenting tables rows that can be updated directly

|--------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|

\* 'unbound' variants can be used with Core Data (where values are bound by alternative means)

## Column Sorting

From the demo app, an example of using the sort capability. When the user clicks on a header column for the first time, it is sorted in ascending order, with an up-arrow "‚ñ≤" indicator. If clicked a successive time, a descending sort is executed, with a down-arrow "‚ñº" indicator.

```swift
private func header(_ ctx: TablerSortContext<Fruit>) -> some View {
    LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
        Text("ID \(Sort.indicator(ctx, \.id))")
            .onTapGesture { tablerSort(ctx, &fruits, \.id) { $0.id < $1.id } }
        Text("Name \(Sort.indicator(ctx, \.name))")
            .onTapGesture { tablerSort(ctx, &fruits, \.name) { $0.name < $1.name } }
        Text("Weight \(Sort.indicator(ctx, \.weight))")
            .onTapGesture { tablerSort(ctx, &fruits, \.weight) { $0.weight < $1.weight } }
        Text("Color")
    }
}
```

## Bound data

When used with 'bound' variants (e.g., `TablerListB`), the data can be modified directly. From the demo:

```swift
private func brow(_ element: Binding<Fruit>) -> some View {
    LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
        Text(element.wrappedValue.id)
        TextField("Name", text: element.name)
            .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())
        Text(String(format: "%.0f g", element.wrappedValue.weight))
        ColorPicker("Color", selection: element.color)
            .labelsHidden()
    }
}
```

## Colored Rows

The demo app (link below) shows how colored rows are implemented. 

Because the normal selection is obscured with colored rows, the ability to use a 'selection overlay' is provided. An example is seen in the demo.

## Disable Header

The demo app shows how to turn off the header, where a header isn't desired.

## Moving Rows

TODO add details here, with example of move action handler.
